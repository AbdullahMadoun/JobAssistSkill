Method:
1. Read the full posting.
2. Extract only what is explicit or directly implied by the role text.
3. Separate required vs preferred carefully.
4. Normalize duplicates while preserving the employer''s meaning.
5. Use empty strings or empty arrays when the posting does not provide enough evidence.

Decision rules:
- Treat an item as required only when the posting clearly signals must-have language, core responsibilities, or a direct qualification. If unclear, place it in preferred_skills.
- Do not infer technologies, certifications, education, or years of experience from company name, team name, or industry alone.
- Seniority mapping: intern/junior/associate -> entry; mid-level/intermediate -> mid; senior -> senior; lead/staff/principal/head -> lead; unclear -> unknown.
- Responsibilities should be action-oriented duties, not employer marketing copy.
- Keep list items concise, deduplicated, and under 8 words when possible.
- Put each keyword in the single most specific taxonomy bucket available.
- Preserve important acronyms and canonical spellings where possible.
- Output valid JSON only.

Edge-case disambiguation example:
Input snippet: "Looking for someone who knows their way around AWS and has strong communication skills. Must have 3+ years in Python."
Reasoning: "knows their way around AWS" is soft language -> preferred. "Must have 3+ years in Python" is explicit -> required. "strong communication skills" is explicit -> soft_skills.
Result: required_skills: ["Python"], preferred_skills: ["AWS"], soft_skills: ["communication skills"], experience_years: "3+".""",

Multi-dimensional scoring rubric:

keyword_match (weight 40%):
- 90-100: Nearly all critical job keywords are explicitly present
- 70-89: Most keywords present but some important ones missing
- 50-69: Partial keyword coverage, several gaps
- 30-49: Minimal keyword overlap
- 0-29: Almost no target keywords found

evidence_quality (weight 35%):
- 90-100: Bullets use specific deliverables, quantified outcomes, named tools/systems, and clear ownership
- 70-89: Good specificity but missing scope, scale, or measurable outcomes
- 50-69: Generic accomplishments without metrics or specificity
- 30-49: Duty-only wording with no evidence of impact
- 0-29: Vague or irrelevant content

relevance (weight 25%):
- 90-100: Every bullet directly addresses a job requirement
- 70-89: Most bullets are relevant, a few are tangential
- 50-69: Mixed - some relevant, some filler
- 30-49: Mostly tangential to the target role
- 0-29: Section content does not relate to the job

overall = (keyword_match * 0.40) + (evidence_quality * 0.35) + (relevance * 0.25)

Bullet review rules:
- You MUST review EVERY bullet point or significant line in each section. Do not skip any.
- verdict "strong": The bullet is specific, well-framed, uses relevant keywords, and needs no changes.
- verdict "adequate": The bullet is acceptable but has clear room for keyword injection, sharper framing, or better evidence.
- verdict "weak": The bullet is vague, duty-only, missing keywords, or poorly framed.
- For adequate and weak bullets, ALWAYS provide a concrete suggestion - even small improvements count.
- Bias toward finding improvements: the user has full control over accepting/rejecting, so flag everything that could be better.

Method:
1. Treat the parsed job requirements as the target rubric.
2. Read the CV section by section, then bullet by bullet.
3. Score each section on all three axes using the rubrics above.
4. Review every single bullet within each section and assign a verdict.
5. Suggest only edits that could be made truthfully from existing CV evidence.

Rules:
- Use only the CV text provided. Do not use outside knowledge or fill gaps from common assumptions.
- If a skill, tool, responsibility, certification, or metric is not in the CV, treat it as missing.
- suggestions must be concrete rewording moves that expose existing evidence more clearly; avoid vague advice.
- Do not recommend adding facts, years, employers, certifications, or numbers not already present.
- overall_score should reflect fit for this role, not writing polish alone.
- overall_verdict should be direct and evidence-based.

- Prioritize repeated must-have requirements and the sections recruiters scan first: summary, experience, projects, and skills.
- For every bullet, aim for the STAR ladder: [Action Verb] + [Specific Deliverable/Problem] + [Tool/Domain/Context] + [Scope/Stakeholder/Complexity] + [Result or Business Value].
- If no metric exists, improve ownership, scale, cadence, complexity, collaboration, or enablement language instead of inventing numbers.
- Replace duty wording with accomplishment wording. "Responsible for" and "worked on" are weaker than concrete ownership and outcomes.
- Use exact job keywords only when they are truthfully supported by the CV or vault. Natural integration beats stuffing.
- Keep or expand sections that carry unique evidence for the target role; compress or de-emphasize low-signal sections if space is tight.
- Many \\item bullets have a truthful upgrade path, but not all deserve a rewrite in every run. Prioritize the ones with the highest alignment value.

Your job is to propose high-value, truth-preserving replacements that can be applied with native string substitution.

}

Workflow:
1. Read the alignment analysis and identify the biggest evidence gaps.
2. Form a CV strategy first: decide which sections should stay prominent, which should be tightened, and which evidence gaps deserve the strongest bullet rewrites.
3. Inspect every provided LaTeX source line in order.
4. Return exactly one change object for every bullet or sentence in the provided source.
5. Copy original_text character-for-character from the provided source.
6. For bullet lines (\\item), choose between "edit" and "keep" based on value and the requested rewrite coverage target.
7. Prioritize the bullets with the strongest truthful upside first; leave lower-value bullets as "keep" when appropriate.
8. For non-bullet structural lines (section headers, formatting commands), set change_type to "keep" unless a meaningful improvement exists.
9. Use the alignment priority_gaps and evidence_candidates as the default map for what to fix and where to fix it.

STAR FORMAT ENFORCEMENT (for experience/project bullets):
Every edited bullet should follow this structure when possible:
[Action Verb] + [What was delivered/solved] + [Context: tools, scope, stakeholders] + [Result: metric, outcome, or enabled capability]

Examples of STRONG rewrites:
\\item Optimized PostgreSQL queries across 15 microservices, reducing average response time by 85%
\\item Led migration of monolithic application to microservices architecture using Docker and Kubernetes, serving 500K daily active users
\\item Designed RESTful API for mobile app, enabling real-time data sync for cross-functional product teams

Examples of WEAK edits (avoid these):
- Adding only an adjective: "Built" -> "Successfully built"
- Single keyword swap: "databases" -> "PostgreSQL databases" without improving the rest
- Cosmetic punctuation or capitalization changes only

ENTITY VALIDATION CHECKLIST (run for every edited_text):
1. Extract all factual entities: hard skills, tools, metrics, certifications, companies, titles.
2. For EACH entity, verify it exists in either the original CV source OR the vault experience.
3. If ANY entity is unsupported: set is_hallucinated = true, add it to risks.
4. If >2 unsupported entities in one change: fall back to a safer rewrite.

KEYWORD DENSITY AWARENESS:
- If a target keyword appears 0 times in the resume: HIGH priority - find a truthful place to insert it.
- If a keyword appears 1-2 times: MEDIUM priority - add only if natural.
- If a keyword appears 3+ times: LOW priority - do not stuff, focus on other improvements.
- Natural integration test: if the edited bullet reads like "keyword keyword doing keyword", rewrite more naturally.

Per-change checklist:
- exact_match: original_text is a full, exact substring from the provided LaTeX source.
- single_scope: the change replaces one bullet or one sentence only.
- material_gain: the edit adds a supported keyword, sharper evidence, clearer scope, or an already-supported metric.
- grounded: every hard skill, tool, certification, employer, title, and number in edited_text is supported by the original CV or the provided vault experience.
- latex_safe: preserve the structural wrapper already present, such as \\item or \\textbf{}.
- concise: keep the result resume-ready and one-page friendly.

STRICT CONSTRAINTS (violating any = failure):
DO NOT:
- Invent skills, tools, certifications, employers, job titles, or dates not in the source.
- Merge multiple bullets into one (maintain 1:1 source:output mapping).
- Add metrics or numbers not supported by CV or vault experience.
- Reorder sections or change structural hierarchy.
- Use vague modifiers ("various", "multiple", "several") without specifics.
- Copy job description verbatim into resume bullets.
- Use buzzwords without concrete evidence ("synergy", "rockstar", "ninja").
- Return adjective-only tweaks, single-word insertions, or cosmetic edits as the only improvement.

IF uncertain about any constraint:
- Choose the safer edit (tighten wording, improve action verb, clarify scope).
- Flag for review in risks field.
- NEVER guess or approximate factual claims.

Rules:
- Every source line must be accounted for. Do not omit any bullet or sentence from the response.
- Return 3-6 strategic_recommendations that cover section emphasis, detail level, ordering, or what to trim/expand for this role.
- original_text must be copied verbatim, including punctuation, spacing, and escaping.
- edited_text should usually preserve the same LaTeX command wrapper as original_text.
- Prefer full bullet rewrites over tiny keyword swaps.
- For edited bullets, aim to improve at least TWO of: keyword coverage, specificity, ownership, scope, outcome framing, ATS clarity.
- Use "keep" for bullets that are already strong, lower-priority, or outside the requested rewrite-coverage budget.
- Prefer edits that directly address alignment.priority_gaps using alignment.evidence_candidates before inventing your own rewrite targets.
- Do not merge bullets, reorder sections, or rewrite large blocks at once.
- reason must name the exact requirement, keyword gap, or evidence weakness being fixed.
- target_keywords should include only the terms this specific change improves.

Mini example:
- Valid edit: {"change_type":"edit","section_name":"Experience","importance":"recommended","original_text":"\\\\\\item Built dashboards for internal teams.","edited_text":"\\\\\\item Built analytics dashboards enabling data-driven decision-making for cross-functional internal teams.","reason":"Adds supported 'analytics' keyword and clarifies scope/outcome framing.","target_keywords":["analytics","data-driven"],"is_hallucinated":false}
